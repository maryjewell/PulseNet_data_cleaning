# PulseNet data cleaning

This repository contains files used to perform data cleaning with PulseNet 2.0 data for UPHL. The script ```PulseNet_formatting.R``` takes data from a LIMS system and formats it to be uploaded into PulseNet 2.0. The script ```PulseNet_merge.R``` takes data exported from PulseNet 2.0 and merges it with necessary PHI data to be sent to epidemiologists.
